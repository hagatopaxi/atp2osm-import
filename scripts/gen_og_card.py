"""Generate the social sharing card (og:image): static/img/og-card.png.

PURPOSE
    Produces the 1200x630 image referenced by the og:image / twitter:image tags
    in website/templates/_base.html. It is the preview shown when a page of the
    site is shared on social networks, in a chat, or quoted by an LLM.

WHEN TO REGENERATE IT
    One-off script, NOT called at runtime nor at build time: the PNG it produces
    is committed to the repository and served as-is as a static asset. Run this
    script again only when the visual must change (logo, text, colors), then
    commit the new static/img/og-card.png.

HOW IT WORKS
    1. Rasterize the project SVG logo (static/img/logo.svg) to a bitmap
       through resvg.
    2. Compose on a white 1200x630 background: logo on the left, mono text on
       the right.
    3. Write the optimized PNG to static/img/og-card.png.

WHY resvg (and not cairosvg)
    The logo contains <mask> elements (the white holes of the pins) and a
    mix-blend-mode:multiply (the overlap of the two pins). cairosvg rasterizes
    those layers at the viewBox resolution (16px) then upscales them -> blurry
    holes and ignored blend. resvg (a Rust engine) rasterizes them at device
    resolution: crisp holes and a correct multiply overlap, faithful to the
    browser rendering.

DEPENDENCIES / RUNNING
    Pillow (already in the project) + resvg-py. resvg-py is only a generation
    tool, not a runtime dependency: it is injected on the fly through uv so as
    not to pollute pyproject.toml.

        uv run --with resvg-py python scripts/gen_og_card.py
