"""Measure, tag by tag, how often NSI agrees with the OSM objects of a country.

NSI_WRITABLE_TAGS is not a universal constant: it was produced by measuring
agreement on French data, and a tag that misbehaves elsewhere produces no
error, only thousands of badly tagged objects. So the list is measured again
for every country — see specs/03_internationalisation.md §6.

    OSM_DB_NAME=… OSM_DB_USER=… OSM_DB_PASSWORD=… OSM_DB_HOST=… OSM_DB_PORT=… \
        uv run python scripts/calibrate_nsi_tags.py countries/fr.json

Prints the table and, unless --dry-run, writes the two keys of the country
file: `nsi_writable_tags` (the tags above the threshold) and `nsi_calibration`
(the whole measurement that justifies the selection). Nobody copies a rate by
hand; a new NSI release is re-evaluated by rerunning this and diffing.

Read-only on the database: everything it creates lives in a schema it drops on
the way out.
