"""Quick-pick reasons for invalidating an ATP suggestion.

Keys follow a `<subject>_<problem>` structure — subject first so the reasons
group by the field they blame, problem second so the same wording means the
same thing across subjects. They are what gets stored in
`import_history.comment`, so a label change never rewrites history. The labels
themselves live in `website/templates/_error_reasons.html`, where a translated
string can be resolved inside a request. Derived from the free-text comments of
the first 131 rejections in production.
