"""The phone key, generated from the country rather than migrated into it.

A phone number is written a dozen ways, and matching two POIs on it is a match
written into OpenStreetMap: the key both sides are reduced to is the national
significant number, the digits left once the international prefix and the
trunk prefix have been removed, in that order.

Only two values depend on the country, and they are constants of the SQL
function rather than parameters: it is IMMUTABLE and used in functional
indexes, so it cannot read anything at call time. That is also why this lives
here instead of in a migration — a new country must cost a configuration file,
never a schema change. The function is (re)generated whenever those values
move, and the indexes built on it are rebuilt with it.
