"""Rebuild-when-needed guard for derived objects.

An object's content depends on two things: the code that builds it, and the
datasources it reads. Both are folded into a signature stamped on the object
itself as a COMMENT, and compared before rebuilding. The code half is a single
value, `_version.app_version()` — see there for why it is not a digest.

This exists because the alternatives both fail:

* rebuilding every night costs a minute for nothing, 364 nights out of 365;
* guarding on the freshness of a single datasource silently freezes the object
  when *another* one moves — mv_places reads nsi_brands as well as the OSM
  tables, and mv_places_brand reads mv_places and atp_fr.

Listing the inputs is therefore not optional: an input left out is an update
that never lands. Whatever an object reads, pass it here.
