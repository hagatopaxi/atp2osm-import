"""
Pipeline runner — event-driven DAG executor.

Pipeline format
---------------
A pipeline is a plain ``dict`` mapping step names to entries::

    PIPELINE = {
        "step-name": (function, ["successor-a", "successor-b"]),
        "step-name": (function, ["successor-a", "successor-b"], {options}),
        ...
    }

Each entry is a tuple of:

* **function** — callable with no arguments, or ``None`` for a virtual/anchor
  node (useful as a named starting point with no work of its own).
* **successors** — list of step names that become eligible to run once this
  step completes.
* **options** *(optional)* — a ``dict`` of execution hints (see below).

Execution model
---------------
Steps start as soon as **all their direct predecessors** have completed.
Unrelated branches run fully in parallel and never wait for each other — there
is no synchronisation barrier between branches.

Step options
------------
Options are passed as the third element of a step's entry tuple.

``lock`` : str
    Serialise steps that share the same lock name. Only one step holding a
    given lock name runs at a time; any other step that reaches that lock will
    queue and wait for it to be released before starting.

    Typical use: bandwidth-heavy operations where true concurrency would
    saturate the network or a shared resource::

        "osm-download": (download_pbf, ["osm-import"], {"lock": "network"}),
        "atp-download": (download_atp, ["atp-extract"], {"lock": "network"}),

    Both downloads become eligible at the same time, but only one executes;
    the other starts the moment the first finishes. Their downstream steps
    (``osm-import``, ``atp-extract``) then proceed independently.

CLI commands
------------
Run from the project root with ``python -m src.pipeline [command]``:

``start`` (default)
    Run the full pipeline starting from the ``"start"`` node.

``from <step>``
    Run ``<step>`` and all steps reachable from it.

``step <step>``
    Run a single step in isolation (no predecessors, no successors).

``list``
    Print all steps in topological order, showing successors and any
    ``lock`` annotation.
