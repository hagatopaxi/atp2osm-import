#
# Not a universal constant: produced by scripts/calibrate_nsi_tags.py, which
# measures for each NSI tag how often it agrees with what French OSM objects of
# the same brand already carry. Kept here: at least 98% agreement over at least
# 50 objects. Rerun the script to re-establish it — never edit it by hand, and
# never copy it to another country.
#
# Deliberately out, all three well under the threshold and for the same reason:
# name (86.2%), brand (97.0%) and operator (96.7%). Their disagreements are
# systematic, not noise — NSI carries the national umbrella where the ground
# carries the real, more precise entity (Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne, Banque
# Populaire Alsace Lorraine Champagne), and NSI leads or trails rebrandings
# (SG / Société Générale, TotalEnergies / Total). Writing them would destroy
# better information than ours.
#
# The primary keys below (shop, amenity, office, tourism, leisure, healthcare,
# craft) measure 100% by construction: nsi_match already drops a primary key
# the object disagrees with, see migration 021.
