"""Backfill: rebuild import_departements from the logs.

Every integration left a `logs/<brand_wikidata>/<date>.json` file holding two
concatenated JSON arrays:

  1. the submitted POIs — with their département, their before/after tags and
     the `changeset` key written at upload time (so including a département
     whose upload later failed);
  2. the ids of the *successful* changesets.

Crossing the two gives, département by département, the count, the attempted
changeset and its fate — exactly one import_departements row. The before/after
tags give tags_count along the way, and the number of POIs actually uploaded
gives items_count.

The success, partial_* and error_* cases are all covered:
  - a département whose changeset appears in array 2 → success;
  - otherwise → error_osm_api / error_unknown, the suffix taken from the
    integration status (the two levels cannot diverge: the suffix already
    comes from the same errors).

A few logs did not keep the `changeset` key on the POIs: since the successful
ids were recorded in département order, they are handed back in that order.

Not backfilled: cancellations (`cancelled`, no changeset attempted), empty
integrations, those whose log file is missing, and the very first logs, older
than the recording of the département. The latter keep a trace of their
changesets in their comment, for want of anything better.
